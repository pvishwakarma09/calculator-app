        <h1>About The Calculator App</h1>

        <p> " Simple implementation of a calculator in JavaScript, HTML, and possibly CSS.
            Let's break down how each part of the code works and what it does: " <br> <br>
            1.) HTML Structure: <br> <br> ➡️ The HTML part of this code should contain at
            least an input field with the ID "inputtext" and a set of buttons. <br> ➡️
            The buttons are likely labeled with numbers, arithmetic operators (+, -,
            *, /), and control function like "AC" (all clear), "DEL" (delete), and
            "=" (equals). <br><br> 2.) JavaScript Operations: <br> <br> ➡️ const input =
            document.getElementById("inputtext");: This line retrieves the input
            field from the HTML by its ID "inputtext". <br> ➡️ const buttons =
            document.querySelectorAll("button");: This line selects all button
            elements from the HTML. <br> ➡️ const calculate = (expression) => {...}: This
            function takes an arithmetic expression as input evaluates it using new
            Function(), and returns the result or an error message if the expression
            is invalid. <br> ➡️ const operation = (buttonValue) => {...}: This function
            is called when a button is clicked. It handles different button actions
            based on their values. <br> ➡️ For example, if the button is a number or
            operator, it appends it to the input field; <br> ➡️ if it's "AC", it clears the
            input field; if it's "DEL", it deletes the last character from the input
            field; and if it's "=", it calculates the result. <br> ➡️
            buttons.forEach((button) => {...}): This loop adds a click event
            listener to each button. When a button is clicked, it calls the
            operation function with the button's value as an argument. <br> ➡️ Event
            Listeners: Each button has an event listener attached to it. When a
            button is clicked, the associated function (operation) is called with
            the button's value (the text displayed on the button) as an argument. <br> ➡️
            Error Handling: The calculate function uses a try-catch block to handle
            potential errors that may occur during the evaluation of the expression.<br> ➡️
            If an error occurs (e.g., due to a malformed expression), it returns the
            string "Malformed Operation".
